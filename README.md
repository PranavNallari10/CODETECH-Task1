Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis Project Overview
Overview:
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aims to perform a thorough examination of a given dataset to understand its main characteristics, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and visualize the relationships between variables. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process, serving as a foundation for further statistical analysis or machine learning modeling.

Objective:
The primary objective of this EDA project is to uncover insights from the dataset through various data visualization and analysis techniques. By performing EDA, we aim to:

Understand the basic structure and distribution of the data.
Identify and handle missing values.
Detect outliers and anomalies.
Explore relationships and correlations between variables.
Provide actionable insights that can guide further analysis and decision-making.
Key Activities:
Data Loading:

Importing necessary libraries.
Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Initial Data Exploration:

Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
Checking the basic statistics of the dataset.
Identifying and handling missing values.
Understanding the distribution of the target variable (if applicable).
Univariate Analysis:

Plotting histograms for numerical features to understand their distributions.
Creating KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plots for numerical features.
Using boxplots to detect outliers in the data.
Multivariate Analysis:

Exploring relationships between different features using pair plots.
Computing and displaying the correlation matrix.
Visualizing the correlation matrix using heatmaps.
Creating scatter plots for numerical features to explore relationships further.
Insights and Conclusions:

Summarizing the findings from the EDA.
Highlighting any patterns, trends, or anomalies discovered in the data.
Identifying potential areas for further analysis or data preprocessing steps needed.
Technologies Used:
